## Some Useful Installation Tips ( Ubuntu )

If you have already installed python 2.7 install python3 as well but it may be the problem that the packages are installed with respect to python 2.7 and shows error for the python 3 packages,

So, you need to install a Virtual Environment for the python3 to install python3 packages.

```
    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 py3env
    source py3env/bin/activate
    pip install package-name
```

After setting virtual environment install packages listed above and Enjoy.
